Features Left to Implement

Testing
Problems:
Lots of issues with responsive editing when working in smaller resolutions. Dev tools unable to frequently find my media queries making it difficult to progress. Crashes galore on Chrome made for a frustrating task.
Bugs:
Logos disappearing in tablet and mobile responsive modes.

Validator Testing
* HTML
    * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
* CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)
* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
