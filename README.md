SQUILYMPIC GAMES

Squilympic Games is a 'Puzzle/Memory Game' based on the hit TV show Squid Game. Players have to match the correct pair of tiles from a selection of 18. Each tile features a character or symbol from the TV show. Once all pairs are matched, the game is complete. You can try again by hitting the RESTART button. This will shuffle the tiles and create a new board. You can go for Easy, Medium , Hard and Ultra difficulty settings. Good luck!

What to expect when a user clicks on one of the tiles?

There are 18 tiles in total. 2 tiles featuring the exact same paired character or symbol from the TV show. Making a total of 9 different characters and         combinations. Once one tile is flipped, it stays open until the user selects another tile. If it's a match, then they will both turn white. If it's not a match, then they will both flip back around and the user tries again. If the user has exceeded their amount of turns, dependant on difficulty setting, then they will lose. The user keeps on going until they find all the tiles, or run out of tiles, whichever comes soonest. The user must press the Restart button 'AFTER' selecting a new difficulty setting for the changes to take effect. Users will be notified of their results at the end of the round.

Testing Problems:

Lots of issues with responsive editing when working in Chrome Dev Tools. Looks ok in dev tools, but then when tested outside of dev tools, its not following the correct way or commands. 
Issues in GitPod servers going down causing loss of data and having to restart some parts of the development again. 

Bugs:

When switching to a new screen size, some strange image behaviours take place during the transition. It's ok when it reaches it's destination resolution though.

Unfixed Bugs

Responsive issues and getting the game on larger screens sizes proved problematic using media queries. I need to allocate more time into learning this and I have purchased various books to assist me. Unable to find answers I required online or Slack at this moment, nbut i'm sure they are out there. Not much in terms of lessons on this in the previous modules.
More time, I had 10 days knocked off my chances to make this better due to our holiday being moved due to covid back in early October, SC was informed. Fulltime job, being a Dad of 2, husband and catching covid back in early Nov has'nt helped with time to research and learn more during the course. 

Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps I did are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
* In the left pane, scroll down to Pages. 
* Once Pages has been selected, the page will be automatically to indicate the successful deployment.

Need to update this section with references where I got my content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
