SQUILYMPIC GAMES

Squilympic Games is a 'Puzzle/Memory Game' based on the hit TV show Squid Game. Players have to match the correct pair of tiles from a selection of 18. Each tile features a character or symbol from the TV show. Once all pairs are matched, the game is complete. You can try again by hitting the RESTART button. This will shuffle the tiles and create a new board. You can go for Easy, Medium , Hard and Ultra difficulty settings. Good luck!

What to expect when a user clicks on one of the tiles?

There are 18 tiles in total. 2 tiles featuring the exact same paired character or symbol from the TV show. Making a total of 9 different characters and   pairs. Once one tile is flipped, it stays open until the user selects another tile. If it's a match, then they will both turn green. If it's not a match, then they will both flip back around and the user tries again. The user hs a few milliseconds to memorize the tiles positions. If the user has exceeded their amount of tries, dependant on difficulty setting, then they will lose. The user keeps on going until they find all the tiles, or run out of tiles, whichever comes soonest. The user must then press the RESTART button to play again. Users will be notified of their results at the end of the round.

Testing Problems:

   * Ability to select 3 cards in quick succession instead of 2 *FIXED 22/04/2022*
   * Ghosting of the tiles when holding finger on them *FIXED 21/04/2022*

Bugs:

When switching to a new screen size, some strange image behaviours take place during the transition. It's ok when it reaches it's destination resolution though.

Validator Testing

* HTML
    * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

* CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

* JS 
    * Few errors were found when passing through Beautyfy Tools validator.
    * No errors were found when passing through esPrima.org validator.

Unfixed Bugs

Using vendor script to fix ghosting issue. This come sup as a warning in validation of JS but is perfectly normal and does not effect the game or design in anyway.

Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps I did are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
* In the left pane, scroll down to Pages. 
* Once Pages has been selected, the page will be automatically to indicate the successful deployment.
